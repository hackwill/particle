    <h3> CincyHacks </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Making History</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I can say with much pride that I was involved in the first ever student ran hackathon in the Cincinnati area called Cincyhacks. With running crowd control and racing from group to group answering coding questions. I somehow stayed up all twenty-four hours to help my team finish our project, and we still got first place in one of the categories winning a bluetooth speaker.</p>

    <h3> Silicon Edge Robotics </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Robot Competition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people may see me as a solfware only type of guy. But joining the First Tech Challenge team Silicon Edge 10341.  Being part of this challenge was one of the best decisions I have made. While on the team, I gained a new perspective of technology and  broadened my view and knowledge of coding. The experience I came away with, helping to build and code our robot,  was invaluable. Seeing my code producing the commands for our robot, made me more aware of what I was actually coding. Now, I visualize my code as dynamic and think  about the end product of mycoding before I touch the keyboard.</p>

    <h3> Custom IOS app </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>App Development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>1/3/2018 The new Mason High School superintendent asked myself and a small group of students to develop a name to face mobile app for IOS, so he could get to know his staff. One of the big issues we came across was that none of us had a Mac. When we realized we needed MacOS to code in Swift and Xcode, we started looking for other was to get this App built.
After digging around we found a work around, a program called phonegap, which can take Html, Css,and<br/>Javascript and turns it into a mobile application for IOS. <br/>We are still building the mobile app.</p>
