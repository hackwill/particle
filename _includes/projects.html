    <h3> CincyHacks </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Making History</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I can say with much pride that I was involved in the first ever student ran hackathon in the Cincinnati area called Cincyhacks. With running crowd control and racing from group to group answering coding questions. I somehow stayed up all twenty-four hours to help my team finish our project, and we still got first place in one of the categories winning a bluetooth speaker.</p>

    <h3> Silicon Edge Robotics </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Robot Competition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people may see me as a solfware only type of guy. But joining the First Tech Challenge team Silicon Edge 10341 was one of the best decisions I ever made. While on the team it gave me a new perspective of technology and more specify of coding. Because as I helped to build and code our robot I saw the repercussions of my code playing out on the robot. This made me more aware of what I was actually coding and to think about what i'm coding before I touch the keyboard.</p>

    <h3> Custom IOS app </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>App Development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From 1/3/2018 the new at Mason High School superintendent ask myself and a small group of students to develop a name to face mobile app for IOS. One of the big issues we came across is that none of us had a Mac. When we realized we needed macOS to code in swift and Xcode we almost gave up. But after digging around we found a work around by using a program called phonegap. On this program it could take Html, Css and Javascript and turn it into a moblie app for IOS. <br> And currently from 3/5/2018 we are still building the mobile app.</p>
